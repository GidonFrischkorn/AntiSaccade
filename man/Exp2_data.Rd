A data frame with 126000 rows and 14 columns:
\describe{
\item{Exp}{Label for the Experiment in the whole experiment series}
\item{task}{The task within Experiment 9 from which the data stem from}
\item{ID}{Unique integer code for each subject who participated in the experiment}
\item{Block}{The experimental block a trial was part of.}
\item{block_order}{The position the experimental block was presented at.}
\item{trial}{The trial number of the current trial}
\item{cueLoc}{The cue location coded as a numeric value from 1 to 4.
1 = "top", 2 = "right", 3 = "bottom", 4 = "left"}
\item{stimLoc}{The stimulus location coded as a numeric value from 1 to 4.
1 = "top", 2 = "right", 3 = "bottom", 4 = "left"}
\item{locDist}{The distance between the cue and stimulus location coded as a factor,
"same" = same location for cue and stimulus, "close" = the cue was one spatial position away from the stimulus,
"opposite" = the cue was presented opposite of the stimulus}
\item{FixDur}{The fixation duration preceeding each trial in milliseconds.}
\item{CTI}{The cue target intercal coded in milliseconds.}
\item{stim}{The letter stimulus that was presented to be identified.}
