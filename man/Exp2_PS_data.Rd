A data frame with 47772 rows and 9 columns:
\describe{
\item{task}{The task within Experiment 9 from which the data stem from}
\item{ID}{Unique integer code for each subject who participated in the experiment}
\item{trialNum}{The trial number of the current trial}
\item{trialType}{character labeling the trial type: "exp" for experimental trials, "prac" for practice trials}
\item{taskDiff}{The difficulty of the current trial. This was varied on three levels: easy, medium, hard. For details on the difficulty manipulation see the task description.}
\item{correctResponse}{The response key that was associated to the correct response: either "left" or "right"}
\item{response}{The response given by the subject: either "left" or "right" response}
\item{correct}{Logical variable indicating the response was correct (TRUE) or incorrect (FALSE)}
\item{RTms}{Reaction Time of the response in milliseconds}
