\title{Calculate ezDM parameters}
\usage{
ez.dm(RT, ACC, s = 1, robust = TRUE, use_RTs = "correct")
}
\arguments{
\item{RT}{numeric. A vector of reaction times.}

\item{ACC}{numeric. A vector of accuracies to determine the proportion correct.}

\item{s}{numeric. The diffusion constant. Typically set to 1 or 0.1. The default value is 1.}

\item{robust}{logical. Should robust statistics, that is median and Interquartile range, be used to calculate the ezDM parameters. Default is true.}

\item{use_RTs}{character. Should only correct RTs ("correct") or all RTs (any other character) be used to calculate mean and sd of RTs.}
}
\description{
This functions calculates the ezDM parameters as proposed by Wagenmakers et al. (2007).
For this it takes a vector of reaction times and accuracies, calculates the mean and sd
of the reaction times and the proportion of correct responses and returns the ezDM
parameters.
