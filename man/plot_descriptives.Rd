\usage{
plot_descriptives(data, formula, family, idVar, file = NULL, clean = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that should be aggregated to be optimized for estimating the specified model}

\item{formula}{A \code{formula} or \code{brmsformula} object that is specifies the model to be analyzed.}

\item{family}{The distribution family of the model to be estimated. This will determine how data is aggregated specifically}
}
\description{
This function aggregates data for analyses using brms. In most cases this will be done
for analysis of count data that can be modeled with a \code{binomial} distribution instead
of a \code{bernoulli} distribution on trial level data.
