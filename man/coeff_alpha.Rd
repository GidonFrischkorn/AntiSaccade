\title{Calculate Cronbach's Alpha}
\usage{
coeff_alpha(measurements)
}
\arguments{
\item{RT}{numeric. A vector of reaction times.}

\item{ACC}{numeric. A vector of accuracies to determine the proportion correct.}

\item{s}{numeric. The diffusion constant. Typically set to 1 or 0.1. The default value is 1.}

\item{robust}{logical. Should robust statistics, that is median and Interquartile range, be used to calculate the ezDM parameters. Default is true.}

\item{use_RTs}{character. Should only correct RTs ("correct") or all RTs (any other character) be used to calculate mean and sd of RTs.}
