A data frame with 35280 rows and 13 columns:
\describe{
\item{Exp}{Label for the Experiment in the whole experiment series}
\item{ID}{Unique integer code for each subject who participated in the experiment}
\item{Block}{The experimental block a trial was part of.}
\item{trial}{The trial number of the current trial}
\item{cueLoc}{The cue location coded as a numeric value from 1 to 4.
1 = "top", 2 = "right", 3 = "bottom", 4 = "left"}
