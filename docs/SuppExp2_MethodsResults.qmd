# Methods

```{r load_data, include=FALSE}
data <- SuppExp2_data
nSub <- length(unique(data$ID))
data$CTI_num <- (data$CTI - min(data$CTI))/1000
data$CTI <- as.factor(data$CTI)
data$RTms <- data$RTms + 150
```

## Participants

We recruited `r papaja::printnum(nSub)` participants via Prolific. Participants were required to be 18 to 40 years old, speak English as their first language, and have an approval rate of at least 90% when participating in studies on Prolific.

## Design

The goal of this experiment was to replicate supplementary experiment 1 and evaluate if CTI benefits over a longer range of CTIs.

## Manual Saccade Task

Compared to supplementary experiment 1, in this experiment we extended the range of CTI durations. Specifically, in addition to the CTI durations used in supplementary experiment 1 (50, 100, and 200ms), we added 300 and 400ms as additional CTIs. To avoid extending testing time to much, we removed the longest Fixation Duration (1800ms). Thus, the duration of the fixation prior to cue onset was 200 to 1400ms varied in steps of 400ms. Apart from that, the task remained unchanged and there were the same three experimental blocks. See @fig-task below.

```{r figST}
#| label: fig-task
#| fig-cap: "Illustration of the procedure of one trial in the manual saccade task. The depicted trial is from an anti-saccade block."
knitr::include_graphics(path = "Figure_SaccadeTask2.png")
```

As in Supplemenraty Exp.1, participants indicated which letters they detected by pressing the according letter "P", "B", or "R" on the keyboard. We recorded the response given as well as the response time as the time between onset of the target stimulus until the response.

In each block we ran 240 trials. Thus, each of the three letters, appeared once in each of the four peripheral locations with each of the four fixation durations and five CTIs.

## Data Analysis

```{r include=FALSE}
n_full <- nrow(data)
data <- data %>% filter(RTms > 150, RTms < 10000)
n_filter <- nrow(data)

prop_filter <- (1 - n_filter/n_full) * 100
```

Prior to data analysis we removed trials with reaction times shorter than 50 ms and longer than 5000ms. This resulted in discarding `r papaja::printnum(prop_filter)`% of data.

We analyzed the number of correct responses with a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model assuming the number of correct responses to follow a binomial distribution. We used a logit link function, thus estimating the linear model on the logit-scale. The model was estimated using the R package `brms`.

```{r model_family}
model_family <- brmsfamily("binomial", link = "logit")
```

Specifically, we estimated the mean performance in each block at the shortest CTI duration as separate intercepts. We then included a linear CTI effect for each Block to estimate changes in performance as CTIs get longer. We included random effects for the intercepts and linear CTI effects in each Block. For all parameters, we used moderately informative logistic priors centered on zero with a scale of on one. We estimated parameter with four independent MCMC chains retaining 10000 samples for each chain after 2000 warmup samples.

```{r LinearModel}
linear_model <- bf(correct | trials(nTrials) ~ 
                     # fixed effects
                     0 + Block + Block:CTI_num + 
                     # random effects
                     (0 + Block + Block:CTI_num | ID))
```

```{r Priors}
model_priors <- prior("logistic(0,1)", class = b)
```

```{r sampling_settings}
nChains <- 4
warmup_samples <- 2000
postwarmup_samples <- 10000
```

  summarise(correct = sum(correct), nTrials = n(), .groups = "drop")
```

table_data <- agg_data %>%

            SD = sd(correct/nTrials),
            Min = min(correct/nTrials),
            Max = max(correct/nTrials),
            .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(CTI_num = as.factor(round( (CTI_num + 0.05)*1000)))

names(table_data)[which(names(table_data) == "CTI_num")] <- "CTI"

The summary statistics for the proportion of correct responses in the three different blocks for all CTI duration is given in @tbl-descriptivesCTI. @fig-descriptive displays the changes of performance across the different conditions and includes performance of each subject in each of the conditions.

Figure @fig-PredEffects shows the posterior predictive estimates from the Bayesian GLM for the different experimental blocks and the linear effect of CTI on the proportion correct scale. Comparisons of the posterior estimates (see @tbl-parameters) indicated that at the shortest CTI (50ms) performance in the Pro-Saccade Block was better than in both the Anti-Saccade, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[1]), format = "e")`, and the Random-Saccade block, , $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[2]), format = "e")`. Different to supplementary experiment 1, there was strong evidence in favor for performance at the shortest CTI in the Anti-Saccade block being worse than in the Random-Saccade Block, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(1/abs(hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[3]), format = "e")`.

For both the Pro-Saccade, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[4]), format = "e")`, and the Anti-Saccade Block, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[5]), format = "e")`, there was strong evidence in favor of a linear effect of CTI, leading to better performance for longer CTIs. For the Random-Saccade Block there was moderate evidence in favor of an effect of CTI on performance, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[6]), format = "e")`.

The CTI effect was larger in the Anti-Saccade Block than in the Random-Saccade block,  $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[9]), format = "e")`, and there was moderate evidence for the CTI effect being larger in the Anti- compared to the Pro-Saccade Block, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[7]), format = "e")`. In this experiment, there was also strong evidenve for a larger CTI effect in the Pro- compared to the Random-Saccade block, $BF_{10}$ = `r printnum(abs(1/hyp_results$hypothesis$Evid.Ratio[8]), format = "e")`.
